### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack engeener mostly focused on web development. My work is usually done in laravel and vue js.

However this github account is not representative of my professional work, is just a set various tools/small personal projects related to personal interests related to tecnology.

### Security related tools
[Simplenetcat](https://github.com/DCa23/simplenetcat/) A small tool similar to netcat, done for fun and learning more about networking.

[Bludit bruteforcer](https://github.com/DCa23/bludit_bruteforcer) Simple burteforcing to atack [bludit](https://www.bludit.com/) cms with a dictionary.

Fork of [ducky_interpreter](https://github.com/DCa23/ducky_interpreter) by [ernexto-xload](https://github.com/ernesto-xload).

Basically i forked the project to make small adition, just to be able to load scripts in memory, for the arduino version that does not have a card reader.


### Very old tools
[Webtetris](https://github.com/DCa23/webtetris) Tetris that I coded when I was studying just for fun.

[ClusterVideoConverter](https://github.com/DCa23/ClusterVideoConvert) Small script i modified for a class project. It was used to convert video format distributing the process among different cluster nodes.
